# Aim: Development of Python Code Compatible with Multiple AI Tools

## Objective:
The aim is to integrate multiple AI tools (for example, OpenAI GPT, Google Cloud's AI APIs, or other services) to perform tasks such as text generation, sentiment analysis, and summarization. Then, we compare the outputs from these different APIs and generate actionable insights from the analysis.

## Required Libraries:

Requests: To send HTTP requests to AI APIs.
OpenAI: To interact with OpenAI’s GPT models.
Google Cloud (optional): To use Google’s NLP and AI APIs.
TextBlob or VADER: For sentiment analysis (optional, if you want to compare with another tool).
Pandas: To organize and compare outputs.

```
pip install openai requests textblob pandas
``` 
## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. Set up API Keys and Authentication
You need API keys to connect to the AI services. For OpenAI, for example, you'll need an API key that you can obtain from OpenAI's website. Similarly, for Google Cloud or other AI tools, follow their documentation to get your keys.

```
import openai
import requests
from textblob import TextBlob
import pandas as pd

# Set API keys
openai.api_key = 'your_openai_api_key'

# Define API endpoints for other services
google_api_url = 'https://language.googleapis.com/v1/documents:analyzeSentiment?key=your_google_api_key'
```

2. Function to Integrate OpenAI API (Text Generation)
```
def generate_text_openai(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",  # Or whichever engine you want
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()
```

3. Function to Integrate Google Cloud AI API (Sentiment Analysis)
You can use Google’s Natural Language API for sentiment analysis or other text processing tasks. Below is an example of sentiment analysis integration:
```
def analyze_sentiment_google(text):
    headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
    data = {
        "document": {
            "type": "PLAIN_TEXT",
            "content": text
        }
    }
    response = requests.post(google_api_url, json=data, headers=headers)
    sentiment = response.json()
    return sentiment
```
4. TextBlob for Sentiment Analysis (Alternative)
```
def analyze_sentiment_textblob(text):
    blob = TextBlob(text)
    sentiment = blob.sentiment.polarity  # Ranges from -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)
    return sentiment
```

5. Compare Outputs and Generate Insights
Now, let’s compare the results from OpenAI (text generation), Google Cloud (sentiment analysis), and TextBlob. Based on the results, we can generate insights, such as summarizing a sentiment score or identifying key takeaways from generated content.

```
def compare_apis(prompt):
    # Generate text using OpenAI API
    generated_text = generate_text_openai(prompt)
    
    # Analyze sentiment using Google Cloud API
    sentiment_google = analyze_sentiment_google(generated_text)
    google_sentiment_score = sentiment_google.get('documentSentiment', {}).get('score', 'N/A')

    # Analyze sentiment using TextBlob
    sentiment_textblob = analyze_sentiment_textblob(generated_text)

    # Generate actionable insights based on sentiment scores
    actionable_insights = {
        'Generated Text': generated_text,
        'Google Sentiment Score': google_sentiment_score,
        'TextBlob Sentiment Score': sentiment_textblob,
        'Actionable Insight': ''
    }

    # Insight based on sentiment comparison
    if google_sentiment_score > 0.5 or sentiment_textblob > 0.5:
        actionable_insights['Actionable Insight'] = 'The generated text has a positive sentiment!'
    elif google_sentiment_score < -0.5 or sentiment_textblob < -0.5:
        actionable_insights['Actionable Insight'] = 'The generated text has a negative sentiment.'
    else:
        actionable_insights['Actionable Insight'] = 'The generated text has a neutral sentiment.'

    return actionable_insights

# Test the function
prompt = "Write a paragraph about the importance of AI in healthcare."
result = compare_apis(prompt)

# Convert to DataFrame for better visualization of insights
df = pd.DataFrame([result])
print(df)

```
Explanation:

API Integration:  
We connect to OpenAI for text generation.  
We use Google Cloud's NLP API for sentiment analysis of the generated text.  
TextBlob serves as an alternative for sentiment analysis to compare against Google's results.  

API Comparison:  
We compare the sentiment score from both Google and TextBlob to gauge the emotional tone of the text generated by OpenAI.  
The insight is based on these comparisons. For instance, if the sentiment score from Google and TextBlob suggests a positive or negative tone, it will guide the actionable insights.  

Actionable Insights:  
Based on sentiment scores, the system generates an actionable insight, helping users understand the emotional context of the generated text.

6. Output Example:

When you run the script, the output will look like this:
```
                                      Generated Text  Google Sentiment Score  TextBlob Sentiment Score                         Actionable Insight
0  The advancements in artificial intelligence ...                      0.7                           0.4
```
